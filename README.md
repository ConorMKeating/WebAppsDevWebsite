# WebAppsDevWebsite
Website displaying MySQL data via PHP with cart and login options. Final project for Web Apps Development module.

This website was designed to allow a user to select from 8 different products, which have details stored in an sql database.
It was developed using XAMPP, so phpMyAdmin was used to configure the database. The database contains one table with the following fields,
Id, Title, Description and Price.

The index file was developed using a bootstrap framework and connects to the database via PHP commands. Requirements for the assignement
were that a user could add items to the cart, and update totals if required. Purchasing the items simply required a notification 
to say that the items were purchased.

To run these files:<br>
1 Download the project folder to htdocs folder in XAMPP directory.<br>
2 Run XAMPP.<br>
3 Import the sql database into phpMyAdmin.<br>
4 Navigate localhost to the project folder and index.php if it fails to find it first time.<br>
5 Webpage should become active in window.<br>
